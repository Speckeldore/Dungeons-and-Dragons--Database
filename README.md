Overview
A database driven website will assist with campaign management for games of Dungeons and
Dragons. Campaigns can be as short as a single session, or last for years.
As of 2023, Dungeons and Dragons has captivated over 50 million players globally. DnD was
first launched in 1974, has experienced substantial growth, especially with various online
versions. This immense and diverse player base demonstrates the need for a sophisticated
database-driven website to manage the intricate aspects of DnD campaigns, characters, quests,
items, and more.
DnD serves as the framework that many role playing-games use to this day to craft memorable
worlds and experiences. Our database serves as a scalable and adaptable platform for
organizing these RPG elements. Whether used as a starter template for the broader RPG
ecosystem or for individuals organizing their DnD sessions with friends, this database will serve
as a robust foundation for either scenario.
